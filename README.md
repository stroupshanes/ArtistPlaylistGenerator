# ArtistPlaylistGenerator
This application will create individual, public, and shareable artist playlists from each of your liked songs on Spotify. The application is available for use at http://stroupshanes.pythonanywhere.com/ . Please note that due to restrictions with the Spotify API, users will need to be manually approved for use with this application. If you're interested in using the artist playlist generator, you can creat an issue with your Spotify username and the associated email addresss.
